# tamer-express-js-note-taker

## Description 
This application is a note-taking app that uses Express.js to handle the routing by getting the APIs, reads files and posts said files. When the user clicks on "Get Started" they will be taken to a notes HTML which was routed through Express.js. Here the user has the ability to write a note, which will be then posted to the page as a list item. The user can add as many notes as they wish and said notes will remain on the page.
